***code-distortion/insight*** is a PHP library that allows you to access ***protected*** and ***private*** object methods and properties, as if they were ***public***.

``` php
$myObject->privateMethod();   // "Error: Call to private method ..."

$testObject = new Insight($myObject);
$testObject->privateMethod(); // success
```

This might be useful when testing. [It might be a good idea, or it might not](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/105007/should-i-test-private-methods-or-only-public-ones). It's up to you.

> ***Note***: Using Insight for purposes other than testing is probably a code smell.



## Installation

Install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require code-distortion/insight --dev
```



## Usage

Instantiate an Insight object:

``` php
// build based on an existing object
$myObject = new MyClass();
$testObject = new Insight($myObject);

// or
$testObject = new Insight(new MyClass());
```

`$testObject` will then act as if it ***is*** the original object, but gives you access to its protected and private methods and properties as well.

Read and write protected and private properties:

``` php
$testObject->publicProp = 'something';
$testObject->protectedProp = 'something';
$testObject->privateProp = 'something';

print $testObject->publicProp;
print $testObject->protectedProp;
print $testObject->privateProp;
```

Call protected and private methods:

``` php
print $testObject->publicMethod();
print $testObject->protectedMethod();
print $testObject->privateMethod();
```

These can be useful while testing your code with [phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit):

``` php
$this->testSame('someValue', $testObject->privateProperty);
$this->testSame('someValue', $testObject->privateMethod());
```



### Abstract classes

You can test abstract classes (and classes whose constructor is not public) by passing the *class* when instantiating an Insight object.

``` php
$testObject = new Insight(MyClass::class);
```

> ***Note***: When instantiating Insight with a class like this (instead of an object) you will only be able to access it's *static* methods and properties.

> ***Note***: To test other functionality of an abstract class you will need to have a concrete class that extends the abstract class, and use that instead.



### Static methods and properties

PHP doesn't have `__getStatic()` or `__setStatic()` magic methods either which would help facilitate accessing protected properties.

Instead, Insight lets you access static methods and properties in the same way as regular methods and properties. Just add `StaticProp` or `StaticMethod` after the property or method name respectively:

``` php
// calling them from an Insight object
$testObject = new Insight(new MyClass());
// or
$testObject = new Insight(MyClass::class);

$testObject->privateStaticProp = 'something';
$testObject->privateStaticMethod();

// this syntax is also available allowing you to access them in one line
Insight::{myClass::class}()->privateStaticProp = 'something';
Insight::{myClass::class}()->privateStaticMethod();
```



### Misc

You can access the underlying object or class by accessing the `->insight` property:

``` php
// when instantiated using an object
$myObject = new MyClass();
$testObject = new Insight($myObject);
$testObject->insight; // === $myObject

// when instantiated using a class name
$testObject = new Insight(MyClass::class);
$testObject->insight; // === 'Namespace\To\MyClass'
```
